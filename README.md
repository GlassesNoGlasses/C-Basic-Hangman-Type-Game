# C-Basic-Hangman-Type-Game
A basic hangman game using C code.

/* My first personal C project. The use of a compiler is required (i.e. Gcc, clang, etc.). 
Simply create an executable file using the compiler (i.e. gcc Hangman.c -o play) or if you can, run the existing "play" executable
file with "./play" in a terminal.

Any advice or comments is appreciated!
